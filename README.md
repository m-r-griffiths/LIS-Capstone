The four files in this repository are executed in the following sequence:

One: Vacancy Scraper - to web-scrape Civil Service vacancies

Two: Skill_Patterns - to create the .json file of patterns that are used for matching in the other two files

Three: Skills_ID - to identify the skills, and their importance, in the corpus of expert literature

Four: Gap_Analysis - to identify the difference, in importance, that the skills recieve in expert literatures Vs in Civil Service Vacancies 

***Please note: I have included the Vacancy Scraper code for completness. I am not claiming it as my own work as I had substantial assistance and advice to create it.***
